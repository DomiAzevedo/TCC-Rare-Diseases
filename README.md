# Rare Diseases

This project serves as the final work for the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence course at FGV EMAp. It uses [ORPHANET](https://www.orpha.net) databases to display information about rare diseases in a more visual way, using data visualization and front-end tools, and seeking to facilitate access to information from these data.
